# Census-Income-Dataset
Target of the project is to predict whether a person makes over 50k dollar in  a year.

## Information About the Project

First, data preprocessing steps have been used on the "Census Income" dataset.

Then the dataset is used to construct 6 classification models as follows:
i) Decision tree using gain ratio.

ii) Decision tree using gini index

iii) Na√Øve Bayes.

iv) Artificial neural networks with 1 hidden layer.

v) Artificial neural networks with 2 hidden layers.

vi) Support vector machines.
